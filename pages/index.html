                <h1>Jack Bennett's personal page</h1>

                <p>
                    This is a personal website I set up to keep references to all my projects in one place (mostly programming stuff, since I've got
                    some things on GitHub and some on GitLab). I also plan on taking the opportunity to write about anything else I work on or am
                    interested in.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For some reason I really like the aesthetic of old 'web 1.0' personal websites, which is the look I'm sort of going for with this
                    page. Maybe not 100% <a href="http://boglin.iwarp.com/">true-to-form</a>, but close enough while still being (hopefully) usable.
                </p>

                <!-- TODO website meta-article (my design thoughts) -->

                <p>
                    For anyone who's interested, a (mostly) complete list of the projects I've worked on can be seen
                    <a href="/projects.html">here</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Otherwise, I hope some of the articles here could be a good read!
