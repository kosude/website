                <h1>A very basic personal website</h1>

                <p>
                    I set up this site to keep references to all my programming projects in one place after I began migrating some from GitHub to
                    GitLab (so naturally having a simple profile became less effective), but I also plan on taking the opportunity to write about
                    anything else I work on or am interested in. If anyone comes across this I hope some of the articles here could be a good read.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Considering programming is a pretty significant part of what I am writing about here I've linked the relevant profiles below:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/kosude">GitHub</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/kosude">GitLab</a> <i>(which I eventually plan on fully migrating to)</i></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>My Projects</h2>

                In the future this section will be moved to a dedicated 'portfolio' sub-site, which will be laid out a bit better for that sort of
                thing.
